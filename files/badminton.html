            <ul>
                <li>The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children's game battledore and shuttlecock.</li>
                <li>This game is all about strategy and it is very fast-pace which is the reason as to why I love this sport, you need good reaction time and speed.</li>
                <li>The saves and smashes that you can perform are really cool, and watching pro atheletes play this sport is a surreal experience.</li>
